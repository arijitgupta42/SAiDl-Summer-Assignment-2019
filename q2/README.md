Extracting names from the video file dataset and then tagging on the basis of which action they have been classified in the original dataset. The names and respective tags are stored in a pickle compressed file and then dumped into the trainloader. Preprocessing of files into same height and width is done in the same code which is used to make [video,label] pairs. Model is fed tensor of video and tensor of labels.

Issues: Currently when doing transfer learning, the model is trained on images whereas our input is a video clip. As the dimensions of the input is more than the dimensions of the weight, currently the model is ineffective.
